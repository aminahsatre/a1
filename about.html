<h1> About Beach Volleyball</h1>
<p>
    The courses are 1.5 hours each week and there are beach volleyball classes for all ages and levels including mums,<br>
    dads and kids.Volleyball is a team sport played by two teams on a playing court divided by a net.<br>
    The sport originated in the United States, and is received on a global basis, ranking behind soccer amongst
    participation sports.<br>
    The object of the game is for each team to send the ball regularly over the net to the opponent's court, and to
    prevent the ball from being grounded on the court.<br>
    The ball is put into play by the right back-row player who serves the ball by hitting it over the net to the opponent's court.<br>
    A team can hit the ball three times (in addition to block) to return it to the opponent's court.<br>
    A player is not allowed to hit the ball twice consecutively, except when attempting a block.<br>
    The rally continues until the ball touches the ground, means it goes "out" or a team fails to return it to the opponent's court or commits a fault.<br>
    The team winning a rally scores a point (Rally Point System.When the receiving team wins a rally, it gains a point and the right to serve, and its players rotate one position clockwise.<br>
    The best of three or best of five games will win matches. Each non-deciding game will be won by the team that first scores 25 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).<br>
    If there is a deciding game, it will be won by the team that first scores 15 points with a minimum two-point advantage (no scoring cap).<br>
